# ft_boolean

This repository hosts the `FT_BOOLEAN` library, a small but useful collection of macros and typedefs designed to simplify boolean operations in C projects. The `ft_boolean.h` header provides a straightforward way to work with boolean values, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## Features

The `FT_BOOLEAN` library includes:
- A `t_bool` type definition for boolean values.
- Macros for evaluating evenness of numbers.
- Predefined messages for even and odd number of arguments.
- A `SUCCESS` constant.
